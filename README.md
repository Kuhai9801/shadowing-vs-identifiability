# shadowing-vs-identifiability
Deterministic finite-window shadowing under partial observation for hyperbolic toral maps. This repository provides exact shadowing certificates, arithmetic branch analysis, and numerical demonstrations showing that residual-based trajectory correction can succeed while initial-state identifiability fails, even in the zero-noise limit.
